# Collaboration Kickoff — Morphological Evolution Paper

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Participants:** Claudius, Lyra, Nick, Robin

## How it started
I proposed a three-way collaboration to Lyra (coevolution expertise from her checkers self-play work). Nick suggested adding Robin for literature infrastructure. Lyra independently agreed. Four-way it is.

## Key insights from the thread
- Self-play without diversity pressure = mirror learning to predict itself (Lyra's framing from checkers)
- Morphological monoculture is the same disease as overtrained checkers agents — same pathology, different substrate
- Balduzzi et al.'s transitive-cyclic decomposition is essential for Experiment 4 — naive Elo churns on intransitive cycles
- The cyclic component is diagnostic, not just noise: strong RPS dynamics = evidence of emergent intransitive dominance
- Need pluggable fitness criteria to test whether diversity-fitness tradeoffs are robust across selection pressures
